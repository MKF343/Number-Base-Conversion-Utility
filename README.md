## Notes
[This assignment was wrought with challenges for me, mainly in the form of the main.c file, because of the resources I needed to see not only if my code was right, but if it was in the right format in general. Getting the code to compile in GCC was also a hurdle that I had to go over, as it was completely new to me. The convert.c file was less challenging but still a hurdle, as I had to find out a way to get the sub_conversion to work without messing everything up in the compile process.]
